The Izuba washing station is set close to a nearby river, providing a vital and regular freshwater source for coffee processing. The station is managed by Ntama Appolinaire, who works alongside Prosper Merimee, the operational manager of RM Burundi. Izuba employs 2 full-time staff and around 250 seasonal workers, who are all local to the station. Izuba is situated near the Kibira national park, where the soil and climate are paired well for fantastic coffee production.  Kigeri, Ryamukona, and Mugoyi are the three hills (collines) surrounding Izuba and the three areas in which coffee is collected or delivered from. Each volume of cherry sold to Izuba is recorded by producer and hillside, showing the minute variances in profile from locations surrounding the washing station. In 2020 we bought coffee from 1482 producers, 1169 of which were male and 313 female (around 26%). We processed 453,000kg of cherry, the max capacity of the station is 800,000kg.  All cherry is hand-sorted before a pre-pulp float, underripe or damaged cherry is removed. Once the cherry is sorted and cleaned, it is ready to be dried. The cherries are laid out evenly across raised beds, providing consistent airflow, and height away to prevent moisture and animals from coming into contact with the cherry.  The cherry is dried for between 25 and 30 days, turned constantly when the sun is high and covered during the night. Once the cherry has dried, the now dried outer fruit is removed, and the coffee beans are ready to be organised for packing.", "image": "coffees/Jubilee-Mockup_1512x.webp"}}, {"model": "coffees.coffee", "pk": 5, "fields": {"category": 3, "name": "Timor-Leste Raimutin", "altitude": "1,400 - 1,600 masl", "country": "Timor-Leste", "region": "Ermera", "notes": "CARAMELISED APPLE | RAISIN | CHOCOLATE", "price": 9.5, "amount": 20, "description": "Raimutin Wet Mill is Located in Atsabe, in the Ermera Region of Timor-Leste, a new origin for us at UE with great potential for growth.

They have so far aided with the construction of three washing stations and continue to commit to putting profits back into the communities they support.  Ripe cherry is first floated in water, to separate the fruit by density. The higher the density, the higher the quality of the coffee. This leaves the low density, less mature cherries to float to the surface, which is easily removed from the water.  The station staff then meticulously hand-sort the freshly picked and well-sorted cherry, removing all damaged or underripe fruit by eye. This well-sorted harvest is now pulped, separating the cherry from the parchment coffee. The coffee then undergoes fermentation for a full 24 hours.  Once this stage is complete the parchment is washed again, removing any residual floaters and cherry skin in the process.  The parchment is then transported to raised beds, where the coffee is dried in high. The staff turn the lots regularly to ensure even airflow and sun contact, for a duration of between 15 - 20 days. When the coffee has reached a drying level of around 14%, the coffee is then transported to lower altitudes with higher temperatures, to complete the drying phase.

The cherries are harvested as usual for a washed coffee but then during the second fermentation and the drying stage the coffee is mixed with mandarin skin. Jairo also grows mandarin oranges on his farm so this was almost an inevitable experiment for a forward-thinking producer looking for his next experimental idea.  The resulting cup of coffee has the expected quality of a washed Colombian from Jairo Arcila with delicious chocolatey undertones, but the mandarin processing gives it an incredible marmalade-like quality; smooth and sweet with a lingering mandarin finish.
